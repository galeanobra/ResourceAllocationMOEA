This repository contains the data from the results obtained in the study. The data is organized in the results folder, which contains the "raw" folder (raw results from optimizer and results from LNA, separated by topology type) and "att" folder (attainment surfaces, as described in Section 4.1.). Each topology folder in "raw" contains 30 FUN files and 30 VAR files, each corresponding to a different instance of the topology. The FUN files contain the values of the objectives of the problem, and the VAR files contain the decision variables, where each line corresponds to a solution in the final population of the MOEA.
